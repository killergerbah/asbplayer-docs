After a longer-than-usual break, extension v1.12.0 has been released.

<!-- truncate -->

Lately I have not been able to contribute as much as I'd like to asbplayer, but on the bright side this release sets the record for most contributions from the community.

Thanks to [@mseh1128](https://github.com/mseh1128), [@fuyuka1d3su](https://github.com/fuyuka1d3su), [@artjomsR](https://github.com/artjomsR), [@yaaacha](https://github.com/yaaacha), and [@SpazzTL](https://github.com/SpazzTL) for their contributions. Read the release notes [here](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer/releases/tag/v1.12.0).

asbplayer is now 5 years old but it's not remotely close to being done. Some features I'd like to build:

- Integration with [Yomitan's API](https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-api) for sentence tokenization and word lookups ([requested](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer/issues/789) by [@NovaKing001](https://github.com/NovaKing001)).
- ffmpeg integration for the local video player to speed up audio/screenshot extraction, `mkv` subtitle track detection, in-app video re-encoding.
- A community website where learners can share their progress and cards.
