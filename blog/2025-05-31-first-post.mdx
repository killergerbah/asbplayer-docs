It's been long overdue, but asbplayer finally has a documentation site!

<!-- truncate -->

asbplayer has always appealed to tools-savvy users, but with the upcoming extension version 1.11.0
including an in-app tutorial, it felt appropriate to full-send layman-friendly features and build this site.

A lot of it is just a reorganization of the README but I hope that with community feedback it will improve over time.

In the long run, hopefully asbplayer becomes easier and easier to use, benefitting not just the tools-savvy,
but anyone who wants to learn languages and enjoy doing it.
