Extension v1.13.0 was released a few days ago in response to reports of broken compatibility with YouTube.

<!-- truncate -->

This release was expedited to fix issues exporting cards on YouTube due to the mp3 encoding worker running inside the page,
where YouTube has been recently enforcing different CSP policies for different users.

The rest of the release consisted of contributions from the community:

- Bulk card export from [@agloo](https://github.com/agloo). This was a big, difficult feature that a lot of people wanted. Thank you!
- The WebSocket client is now enabled on Firefox, thanks to [@mwojick](https://github.com/mwojick) taking the intiative to test it out.
- [@ShanaryS](https://github.com/ShanaryS) implemented support for internal Plex subtitles, through careful and meticulous application of the newly-released Plex API docs.
- [@Bennycopter](https://github.com/Bennycopter) and [@extremq](https://github.com/extremq) added subtitle detection for [Comprehensible Japanese](https://cijapanese.com/watch).

Thanks everyone!
