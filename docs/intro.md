# What is asbplayer?

## A language-learning assistant

**asbplayer** is a language-learning assistant that makes it easier to learn languages through subtitled videos. Its original author created for himself to help with learning Japanese using [AJATT](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html). It was then popularized in the [Refold](https://refold.la/) Japanese-learning community as a **sentence mining** and **subtitle** tool. However, asbplayer's feature set is always growing. With asbplayer you can:

- **Easily create high-quality, multimedia flashcards** out of subtitled videos.
- **Load text-selectable subtitles onto most video sources**, including streaming sources. You can use **auto-detected subtitles** on popular streaming services like Netflix and YouTube, or your own **subtitle files**.
- **Seek through subtitles** using a **navigable subtitle list**.
- **Optimize language acquisition** with **playback modes** like:
  - **Condensed playback**: Skip unsubtitled sections of video.
  - **Fast-forward playback**: Fast-forward through unsubtitled sections of video.
  - **Auto-pause**: Automatically pause at the beginning or end of every subtitle.
- **Use customizable keyboard shortcuts** to access most of asbplayer's features.

## A website and browser extension

In order to make asbplayer's as widely available as possible, asbplayer comes in two different forms, a [website](https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer) which works with local video files and a [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/asbplayer-language-learni/hkledmpjpaehamkiehglnbelcpdflcab) which works with streaming video. Neither one is required to use the other - however, they work together to make the asbplayer user-experience as seamless as possible.

## Why use asbplayer?

- You want a way to watch videos with text-selectable subtitles.
- You want a way to create high-quality, multimedia flashcards out of video and subtitle sources.
- The video sources you are using are obscure and not supported by other similar tools.
- You are somewhat tools-savvy. You will most likely need to combine asbplayer with other tools (like a dictionary app) for a complete language-learning toolset.
- You don't want to pay money. asbplayer is free to use and open-source.
