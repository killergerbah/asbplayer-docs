# Android

While the UX is worse, it's possible to use asbplayer on Android devices.

:::warning
**Many features are missing**: the **side panel**, **screenshots**, and the **WebSocket interface**.
:::

## Website

The website can be used as-is. The **Overlay UI** will be displayed instead of the default, desktop-optimized video controls.

## Extension

The asbplayer extension is available on the following Android browsers. As with the website, the primary way to interact with asbplayer will be through the **Overlay UI**.

The side panel is missing, so instead **subtitles are loaded by selecting the asbplayer button from the browser's extension menu.**

Using a (bluetooth) keyboard is not necessary but can be very useful for those who prefer to use keyboard shortcuts with the extension.

### Chromium-based

The asbplayer extension is available for Chromium-based browsers on the Chrome [web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/asbplayer-language-learni/hkledmpjpaehamkiehglnbelcpdflcab) or from the [releases page](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer/releases).

#### Kiwi Browser (discontinued)

Kiwi Browser is a Chromium-based mobile browser that can run extensions. However, it's development has been discontinued and the only way to install it is from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/kiwibrowser/src.next/releases).

#### Edge Canary

Edge Canary is another Chromium-based mobile browser that can run extensions. However, it is very new and there is currently little info on asbplayer's compatibility with it.

### Firefox for Android

Install asbplayer from the [AMO page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/asbplayer-android/). Firefox for Android suffers from the same limitations as Firefox - it's not possible to record audio from DRM-protected streams.
