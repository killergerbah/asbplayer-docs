Some video files have multiple audio tracks. On the website, an audio track selector is available when the **Experimental Web Platform features** flag is enabled from `chrome://flags` (or equivalent for the current browser).

:::warning
There have been reports of the _extension's_ Anki integration being broken when **Experimental Web Platform features** is enabled. Enable this flag at your own risk.
