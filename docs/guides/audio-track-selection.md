# Audio track selection

Some video files have multiple audio tracks. On the website, an audio track selector is available when the **Experimental Web Platform features** flag is enabled from `chrome://flags` (or equivalent for the current browser).

:::warning
As of this writing **Experimental Web Platform features** completely breaks the browser extension for streaming video (on some websites, maybe all). Enable this flag at your own risk.
