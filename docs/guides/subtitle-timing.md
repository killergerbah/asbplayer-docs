# Subtitle timing

Subtitle files will very often not be aligned to the video source you load them into. To work around this, asbplayer provides ways to manually adjust subtitle timing.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The fastest way to fix subtitle timing is with the [keyboard shortcuts](https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/?view=settings#keyboard-shortcuts). There are two sets of shortcuts for adjusting subtitle offset:

- `Ctrl + Left/Right` or `Shift + Left/Right`: Align the current timestamp to the left or right subtitle.
- `Ctrl + Shift + Left/Right`: Move the current timestamp `100ms` to the left or right.

Most often, finding the correct offset will look like this:

1. Wait a character to start talking.
2. `Ctrl + Left/Right` until the subtitle matching the character's dialog appears on screen.
3. `Ctrl + Shift + Right/Left` until the subtitle timing precisely matches the dialog.

## Overlay UI

The overlay UI provides buttons that perform the same functions as the keyboard shortcuts above.

1. Scroll the rightmost section to the **middle** control.
2. Click the left or right button to align the left or right subtitle to the current timestamp.
3. Click and **hold** the left or right button to move the current timestamp `100ms` to the left or right.
